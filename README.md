# Failure_predict_maintainance_model
 machine learning pipeline. The model, a RandomForestClassifier, is trained to predict potential machine failures based on sensor data. This project includes the training notebook, a script for testing the saved model, and a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies. This marks my first-ever model training at OCAC.
